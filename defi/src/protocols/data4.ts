`chain` is the first chain of a protocol we tracked at defillama,
  so if a protocol launches on Ethereum and we start tracking it there, and then it launches on polygon and
  we start tracking it on both polygon and ethereum, then `chain` should be set to `Ethereum`.

`chains` is not used by the current code, but good to fill it out because it is used in our test to detect errors
